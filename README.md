# Global Environmental Health Equity Lab
As of Spring semester 2023, I was recently accepted to work under Wan Nurul Naszeerah in Dr. Layla Kwong's Global Environmental Health Equity Lab within UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. I'm not quite sure the exact scope of what I will be working on with Wan and the lab at large so this file will be updated with more details to come.

## Initial Insights
The initial task is to become familiar with the `malaya` Python library for natural langauge processing of Malay text and to find some initial insights from the [@mediapermata](https://www.instagram.com/mediapermata/) Instagram page.
